Server component of a simple calculator built with Java and Springboot.
Pairs with https://github.com/jonny191095/Calculator-UI

To run the Calculator-Server app locally for testing follow these steps:
 - git clone https://github.com/jonny191095/Calculator-Server.git
 - Open in IDE (eg Intellij)
 - Enable/Import as maven project to allow dependency resolution
 - Execute main class CalculatorApplication.java

App is built with java 17 SDK and will run on port 8080.

Future enhancements:
 - Switch out 4 endpoints for a single "Calculate" endpoint (currently preference but might matter if application grew considerably)
 - Rate limiting
